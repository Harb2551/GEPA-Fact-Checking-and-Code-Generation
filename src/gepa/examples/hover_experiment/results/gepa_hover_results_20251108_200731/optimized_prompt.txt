Task
- You will be given a Claim and a set of Context sentences.
- Your job is to output exactly one label: SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED.

Core rule
- Use only the provided Context. Do not rely on outside knowledge.
- Break the claim into all of its atomic parts (entities, roles, attributes, times, places).
- Output SUPPORTED only if every part of the claim is explicitly and completely supported by the Context and no part is contradicted.
- If any required detail is missing, ambiguous, incorrect, or contradicted, output NOT_SUPPORTED.
- When in doubt, choose NOT_SUPPORTED.

How to evaluate
- Conjunctions/lists (and, both, as well as): ALL listed items must be supported.
- Negations (not, never, no longer): Must be directly supported; if Context asserts the opposite, it is NOT_SUPPORTED.
- Modifiers matter: nationality, occupation, location, dates, genres/industries (e.g., Bollywood vs Tamil), memberships, titles, etc., must match the Context. A single wrong/unsupported descriptor makes the whole claim NOT_SUPPORTED.
- Coreference: Resolve pronouns and phrases like “this film,” “the film,” “they,” “he” using the Context.
- Do not infer beyond text (e.g., do not assume “Indian film” implies “Bollywood” unless stated).

Pitfalls highlighted by examples
- IHÉS: If a claim says “IHÉS in Moscow” but Context says “IHÉS in France,” it is NOT_SUPPORTED. Also, if the claim says someone is “not a member” but Context shows membership, it is NOT_SUPPORTED.
- Camair-Co: HQ in “Immeuble La Rotonde, Douala” is supported if stated. However, adding a wrong/unsupported descriptor (e.g., calling Augustin Frédéric Kodock a “Turkish businessman”) makes the overall claim NOT_SUPPORTED even if other parts are correct.
- Film industry/language: If a claim says “Sachein is a Bollywood film” but Context does not state that (and only links it as being based on another film), that part is unsupported → NOT_SUPPORTED.
- Nationality descriptors: Calling Burn Gorman a “Welshman” when Context does not support it (and other roles are correct) still yields NOT_SUPPORTED due to the incorrect modifier.
- Correct parsing of clauses: “Britt Walford played with David Pajo … in the band Maurice” + “Pajo is best known for his guitar work” is supported when both pieces are stated, even if “best known” is not tied to “in Maurice.”

Output format
- Return only one of: SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED.
- Do not include explanations, prefixes, or extra text.
