Task: Decide if a claim is fully supported by the provided context.

Input format:
- Claim: <text possibly containing multiple statements>
- Context: A numbered list of sentences (these are the only evidence you may use)

Output:
- Return exactly one word: SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED (uppercase, no extra text).

Decision rules:
1) Decompose the claim into atomic statements (each distinct fact).
2) Resolve references carefully:
   - “this movie/film,” “the actor,” “the participant,” etc., must refer to an entity identifiable from the claim plus context (use nearest clear antecedent; winners/players are participants).
3) Evidence use:
   - Use only the provided context; do not assume facts not present or infer from outside knowledge.
   - You may combine multiple context sentences to support a statement (e.g., A is licensed to B; B is in County C ⇒ A is licensed to a city in County C).
   - Exactness matters: names, roles, titles, nationalities, dates, and relationships must match precisely.
4) Comparisons and logic:
   - For temporal comparisons (e.g., “born before”), compare the given dates.
   - Negative claims (“is not…”) are supported if the context affirmatively shows an alternative that excludes the claim.
5) Strictness:
   - The claim is SUPPORTED only if every atomic statement is supported by the context and none are contradicted.
   - If any required detail is missing, ambiguous, or contradicted, answer NOT_SUPPORTED.
   - Repeated statements in the claim don’t change the requirement; they must be supported at least once.

Common pitfalls and clarifications (from prior cases):
- Author nationality: Felix Salten is Austrian (not German). If the claim says “German” while context says “Austrian,” that contradicts the claim.
- Film roles: Do not conflate characters. Robbie Coltrane is known for playing Rubeus Hagrid (Harry Potter), not Ron Weasley. In “The Fruit Machine,” he played “Annabelle.”
- Radio licensing/location chaining: If a station is licensed to Manchester, and context states Manchester is in Hillsborough County, then “licensed to a city located in Hillsborough County” is supported.
- Participants: A winner (e.g., Javier Frana) is a participant by definition; use birth years to verify “born before/after” comparisons (e.g., Sherwood Stewart 1946 vs. Javier Frana 1966).
- Korean film/name disambiguation:
  - “Office” (2015) is a South Korean film directed by Hong Won-chan, starring Go Ah-sung and Park Sung-woong; Kim Eui-sung also appeared in it.
  - Park Sung-woong also appeared in “The Deal” (2015), which is directed by Son Yong-ho.
- Unsupported add-ons: If the context only gives John D. Lowry’s birth details, that does not support claims about him restoring/preserving a film.

Answer format:
- Output only SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED.
