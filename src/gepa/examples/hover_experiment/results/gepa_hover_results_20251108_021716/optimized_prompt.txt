Task: Determine whether a natural-language claim is fully supported by a given context (evidence). Output exactly one of: SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED.

How to decide:
1) Break the claim into atomic propositions (entities, attributes, relationships, dates/years, causes, comparisons).
2) Map each proposition to the context. Use only the provided context; do not rely on external knowledge or assumptions.
3) Require full support:
   - Output SUPPORTED only if every part of the claim is explicitly and unambiguously entailed by the context.
   - Output NOT_SUPPORTED if any part is contradicted by the context, missing from it, ambiguous, or only indirectly implied.
4) Treat the claim as a logical AND of its parts. One unsupported or contradicted sub-claim makes the whole claim NOT_SUPPORTED.
5) Pay special attention to:
   - Dates and years (must match exactly).
   - Roles/titles and memberships (e.g., “main vocalist,” “member of a sub-unit”).
   - Nationalities and “same/different” comparisons (need both sides stated and matching/mismatching accordingly).
   - Marriages/relationships (must match exactly; reject logically impossible statements like someone being married to themself).
   - Causal language (e.g., “due to,” “partly responsible”) must be explicitly stated in the context.
   - Locations (HQ/editors based in X): if the context lists specific places and the claimed place is different or unstated, return NOT_SUPPORTED.
   - Pronouns and ambiguous references: if you cannot unambiguously link them, return NOT_SUPPORTED.
6) Cross-sentence reasoning is allowed if entity links are clear, but do not infer beyond what is explicitly given.

Output format:
- Print only SUPPORTED or NOT_SUPPORTED (uppercase, no explanations, no extra text).

Reference facts seen in similar items (for disambiguation patterns; still rely on provided context for each new item):
- William McKinley framed the McKinley Tariff (Tariff Act of 1890); it was cited as a cause of Republican losses around 1890; McKinley was assassinated in September 1901.
- Ángel Manuel Rodríguez writes a monthly column in Adventist World; Adventist World editors are based in Silver Spring, Maryland and Seoul, Korea; the magazine is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland (not Kentucky).
- Ray (Raymond) Wilson is Scottish; VIXX’s main vocalist Leo (Jung Taek-woon), also of VIXX LR, is South Korean; thus they do not share the same nationality.
- John Cariani’s play premiered at Portland Stage Company in 2004 (not 1986–1993).
- Steven Goldmann directed Broken Bridges (2006), which starred Kelly Preston, who appeared in Twins and Jerry Maguire and is married to John Travolta (not to herself).
- Only the Brave (2006) depicts the 100th Infantry Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team; the regiment’s key combat operations began in 1944; director Lane Nishikawa participated in the Kearny Street Workshop.

Decision tips:
- If the claim says “both A and B have property X,” verify X for both A and B.
- For “same nationality” claims, verify the stated nationality for each entity; if one is missing or they differ, choose NOT_SUPPORTED.
- For causal claims, look for explicit causal wording in the context.
- When in doubt or if any element is not explicitly confirmed, choose NOT_SUPPORTED.
